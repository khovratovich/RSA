\section{Definitions}

\begin{definition}
The \emph{RSA Assumption} states that no
efficient adversary can  compute $e$-th roots a given random group element for a predefined $e$. Specifically,
it holds for $GGen$ if for any probabilistic polynomial time adversary $\mathcal{A}$:
$$
Pr
\begin{bmatrix}
&\mathbb{G}\xleftarrow{\$}GGen(\lambda)\\
u^l = w :
& (w,l)\xleftarrow{\$}\mathbb{G}\\
&u \xleftarrow{} \mathcal{A}(\mathbb{G},w)
\end{bmatrix}\leq \mathrm{negl}(\lambda)
$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
The \emph{strong RSA Assumption} states that 
efficient adversary can  compute no roots of a given random group element. Specifically,
it holds for $GGen$ if for any probabilistic polynomial time adversary $\mathcal{A}$:
$$
Pr
\begin{bmatrix}
&\mathbb{G}\xleftarrow{\$}GGen(\lambda)\\
u^l = w,\; l>1 :
& w\xleftarrow{\$}\mathbb{G}\\
&(u,l) \xleftarrow{} \mathcal{A}(\mathbb{G},w)
\end{bmatrix}\leq \mathrm{negl}(\lambda)
$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
The \emph{QR-strong RSA Assumption} states that 
efficient adversary can  compute no roots of a given random quadratic residue. Specifically,
it holds for $GGen$ if for any probabilistic polynomial time adversary $\mathcal{A}$:
$$
Pr
\begin{bmatrix}
&Z_N\xleftarrow{\$}GGen(\lambda)\\
u^l = w,\; l>1 :
& w\xleftarrow{\$}QR_N\\
&(u,l) \xleftarrow{} \mathcal{A}(Z_N,w)
\end{bmatrix}\leq \mathrm{negl}(\lambda)
$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
The \emph{$r$-Strong RSA Assumption} states that 
efficient adversary can  compute at most $r$-th roots of a given random group element. Specifically,
it holds for $GGen$ if for any probabilistic polynomial time adversary $\mathcal{A}$:
$$
Pr
\begin{bmatrix}
&\mathbb{G}\xleftarrow{\$}GGen(\lambda)\\
u^l = w,\; l\neq r^k,\;k\in\mathbb{N} :
& w\xleftarrow{\$}\mathbb{G}\\
&(u,l) \xleftarrow{} \mathcal{A}(\mathbb{G},w)
\end{bmatrix}\leq \mathrm{negl}(\lambda)
$$
\end{definition}
Remarks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For $r = 1$ the definition is identical to the standard Strong RSA Assumption. 
    \item For $r = 2$, the adversary
is efficiently able to take square roots. In class groups of imaginary quadratic order taking
square roots is easy~\cite{cryptoeprint:2019:1229}.
    \item In $r$-th order class groups taking $r$-th roots is easy~\cite{cryptoeprint:2019:1229}.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{definition}
The \emph{Adaptive Root Assumption} [with security parameter $\lambda$] holds for
$GGen$ if there is no efficient adversary $(\mathcal{A}_0, \mathcal{A}_1)$ that succeeds in the following task. First,
$\mathbb{G}$ outputs an element $w\in \mathbb{G}$ and some state $st$. Then, a random prime $\mathrm{Primes}(\lambda)$ is chosen
and $\mathcal{A}_1(w,st)$ outputs $w^{1/l}\in\mathbb{G}$. For all efficient $(\mathcal{A}_0, \mathcal{A}_1)$:
$$
Pr
\begin{bmatrix}
&\mathbb{G}\xleftarrow{\$}GGen(\lambda)\\
& (w,st)\xleftarrow{}\mathcal{A}_0(\mathbb{G})\\
u^l = w\neq 1 :& l\xleftarrow{\$}\mathrm{Primes}(\lambda)\\
&u \xleftarrow{} \mathcal{A}_1(w,l,st)
\end{bmatrix}\leq \mathrm{negl}(\lambda)
$$
\end{definition}
Remarks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In~\cite{cryptoeprint:2019:1229} $\mathcal{A}_0$ selects $w,st$ randomly, which is probably an error. Also $\mathcal{A}_1$ does not take $w$ as input, which does not make sense.
    \item The number of primes in $\mathrm{Primes}(\lambda)$ should correspond to the hardness of factoring: it is possible to 
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}
The \emph{Order assumption}. For any probabilistic polynomial time adversary $\mathcal{A}$ computing the order of a random element is hard: 
$$
Pr
\begin{bmatrix}
&\mathbb{G}\xleftarrow{\$}GGen(\lambda)\\
u^l = 1 : &u   \xleftarrow{\$}\mathbb{G}\\ 
& (l)  \xleftarrow{} \mathcal{A}(\mathbb{G})\\
\end{bmatrix}\leq \mathrm{negl}(\lambda)
$$

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
The \emph{Low Order assumption}. For any probabilistic polynomial time adversary $\mathcal{A}$ finding any element of low  order is hard: 
$$
Pr
\begin{bmatrix}
&\mathbb{G}\xleftarrow{\$}GGen(\lambda)\\
u^l = 1,\;u\neq 1 :
& (u,l)  \xleftarrow{} \mathcal{A}(\mathbb{G})\\
& \text{and }l<2^{poly(\lambda)}
\end{bmatrix}\leq \mathrm{negl}(\lambda)
$$

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
The \emph{Fractional Root assumption}. For any probabilistic polynomial time adversary $\mathcal{A}$ 
$$
Pr
\begin{bmatrix}
&\mathbb{G}\xleftarrow{\$}GGen(\lambda)\\
u^l = g^{a} : & g \xleftarrow{\$}\mathbb{G}\\
& (u,l,a)  \xleftarrow{} \mathcal{A}(\mathbb{G},g)\\
& \text{and }a,l<2^{poly(\lambda)}
\end{bmatrix}\leq \mathrm{negl}(\lambda)
$$

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
The \emph{Diffie-Hellman Assumption} holds for
$GGen$ if no  efficient $\mathcal{A}$ can compute $g^{ef}$ from $g,g^e,g^f$ for random $g,e,f$:
$$
Pr
\begin{bmatrix}
&\mathbb{G}\xleftarrow{\$}GGen(\lambda)\\
& (g,e,f)\xleftarrow{\$}\mathbb{G}\\
u = g^{ef} :&  u \xleftarrow{} \mathcal{A}(g,g^e,g^f)
\end{bmatrix}\leq \mathrm{negl}(\lambda)
$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\emph{Discrete logarithm}  assumption 
holds for
$GGen$ if for all  efficient $\mathcal{A}$:
$$
Pr
\begin{bmatrix}
&\mathbb{G}\xleftarrow{\$}GGen(\lambda)\\
& (u,w)\xleftarrow{\$}\mathbb{G}\\
w = u^l :&  l \xleftarrow{} \mathcal{A}(u,w)
\end{bmatrix}\leq \mathrm{negl}(\lambda)
$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\emph{Factoring}  assumption states that for random safe primes $p,q$ it is difficult to factor $N=pq$.
\end{definition}


\section{Reductions and security}

\subsection{Trivial reductions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The AR  assumption implies the Low Order assumption. Indeed, for an element $w$ of order $l$ one can compute $q$-th root by setting $u = w^{q^{-1}\bmod{l}}$. 
    \item The Strong RSA assumption implies the RSA assumption (trivially).
    \item The Strong RSA assumption implies the QR-strong  assumption (almost trivial, due to the size of $QR_N$).
    \item The Low Order assumption unconditionally holds in $QR_N$ because it contains no elements of low order.
    \item If the RSA modulus is based on strong primes, then the order problem in $QR_N$ is equivalent to factoring.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Nontrivial reductions}
\begin{theorem}\cite{bach1984discrete}
Discrete logarithm in the RSA group is equivalent to factoring.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\cite[Th. 1]{DBLP:conf/ccs/CramerS99}
Strong RSA assumption is equivalent to the Fractional Root Assumption in the group of quadratic residues modulo $N$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Generic group model}

A generic group algorithm (GGA) is a program that performs only group operations and equality checks. It is modelled as an oracle $O$, who knows the group order $n$, and a random function $\sigma$, called the \emph{encoding}. The algorithm input is $\sigma(x_1),\sigma(x_2),\ldots,\sigma(x_k)$, and the oracle returns $\sigma(x_i\pm x_j\pmod{n})$ on query $(i,j)$. Equivalently, it computes $\prod_{1\leq j \leq k}g_j^{a_j}$ and informs about equal elements in results.

It is crucial that a GGA does not have access to the internal representation of group elements, which are integers in RSA. 
This makes most of RSA assumptions to hold in the generic group model (GGM). 
\begin{theorem}\cite{DBLP:conf/eurocrypt/DamgardK02}
Strong RSA assumption holds in the generic group model.
\end{theorem}
This implies that the regular RSA assumption is hard too. The factoring problem can not be formulated in the GGM as the group size is unknown to the algorithm.
\begin{theorem}\cite{cryptoeprint:2019:1229}
Adaptive Root assumption holds in the generic group model.
\end{theorem}
However, these results give little insight to the actual security of RSA assumptions, as most existing attacks on RSA do use the integer form of the group elements. Jacobi symbol (see below) is an example of an easy problem, which is provably hard in GGM.

\subsection{Generic Ring Model}

Here we consider algorithms that are given the unit ring element $1$ and a single ring element $x$ as input and are supposed to output some element $y$. They can query the ring oracle using multiplication, division, and addition queries on the already known ring elements, and see if the oracle outputs a previously known element. Effectively these algorithms compute rational polynomial functions of $x$.

\begin{lemma}\cite{DBLP:conf/eurocrypt/AggarwalM09}
If there is a GR algorithm that computes $f(x)$ such that  $f(x)\equiv 0 \bmod{n}$ on a non-negligible fraction of points then one can derive a factoring algorithm.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}\cite{aggarwal2011equivalence}
If there is an GR algorithm that solves the strong RSA problem by outputting rational functions $u=\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ and $l=\frac{h(x)}{q(x)}$, then $N$ can be factored with the same complexity.
\end{theorem}
The idea of proof is the following. If $l$ is a rational function that is a constant $c$ on many points, we reduce $u^c$ to Lemma 2. Otherwise it must happen that $l$ as a rational function is a constant $c\bmod{q}$ which yields a factor by GCD.

These results hint that an algorithm that solves an RSA problem without factoring must use the integer representation of the RSA ring. An example is an algorithm for Jacobi symbol computation, which works in $O(\log^3(N))$. However,  computing the Jacobi symbol (or to do any other membership test of certain algebraic property) is as hard as factoring in GRM~\cite{DBLP:journals/joc/JagerS13}.


\subsection{Pseudo-freeness}

Let $A$ be a set of constants and $\mathcal{F}(A)$ be the free group generated by $A$ i.e. the set of all finite products with multiples from $A$. 
\begin{definition}Let $X$ be a set of variables and consider equations of form $w_1 = w_2$ where $w_1,w_2\in\mathcal{A\cup X}$. A group $G$ is \emph{pseudo-free} if no efficient adversary can find an equation that does not have solutions in $\mathcal{F}(A)$ and a solution to this equation in $G$ (i.e. where $X$ and $A$ are mapped to some elements of $G$), where the mapping from $A$ to $G$ is a random function, chosen for every run of the adversary.
\end{definition}

Informally, a group is pseudo-free if no efficient algorithm can find a non-trivial relation among randomly chosen group elements.

\begin{theorem}\cite{DBLP:conf/tcc/Rivest04,DBLP:conf/eurocrypt/Micciancio05}
Assume that $N$ is the product of two safe primes. Then the strong RSA assumption is equivalent to that the RSA group is pseudo-free.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}~\cite{DBLP:conf/tcc/Rivest04} The Order problem is hard in a pseudo-free group.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\cite{DBLP:journals/ijisec/HasegawaIST09}
The Diffie-Hellman assumption holds for a non-negligible fraction of bases $g$ in a pseudo-free group.
\end{theorem}

Therefore, the strong RSA assumption implies the order assumption if $N$ is the product of two safe primes. The situation when the strong RSA assumption holds but the AR assumption does not hold may thus only happen if the order of $w$ in the AR assumption is unknown but roots are computable. 

\subsection{Non-equivalence}

One may ask if the listed assumptions can be proven equivalently hard for all groups. This is not true.
\begin{theorem}\cite{LM71,DBLP:conf/tcc/Rivest04} The Order, RSA, Strong RSA, Discrete Log assumptions are independent: for each pair of assumptions there exist a group where only one of them holds.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Common modulus}
It is easy to see that an adaptive Root oracle is equivalent to an RSA decryption of the same ciphertext under multiple prime encryption exponents. It was shown that if the decryption exponent is relatively small ($N^{0.3}$ and smaller) then $N$ can be factored. It was also demonstrated that if multiple  decryption exponents, all smaller than $h(N)$, are present, then the factorization can be obtained from public exponents, and $h(N)$ for which it is feasible, approaches $N$ if the number of exponents grows. It is unclear if this property can be used to reduce the AR assumption to factoring.
